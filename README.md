# Demo Fictional Pizza Restaurant Website Miniproject

This is a simple website (of a fictional Pizza Restaurant) I am making in order to learn and exercise in Vue.js programming.

It uses Vue.js v2.x as v3.x has just only recently been release and the course I did on Vue covered version 2.

The website includes the use of Vue Router (naturally for routing) and VueX (for state management, the component usually only read static data from the VueX store but the darkMode toggle also writes in it).

It also uses animations (standard css ones, there wasn't a particular no need for the vue ones), mediaqueries and styling implemented using scss.

I have looked around for some inspiration from websites here and there, but anyway basically everything in the website was designed and implemented by me (except from the images and the icons).
